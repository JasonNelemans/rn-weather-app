# React Native Weather App

## About/Goals

This app was intended to introduce me to the React Native framework (through Expo cli), but also to be able to read the current weather ;)

## Highlights

![metric](/assets/metric.png)

The weather by the metric system.

![imperial](/assets/imperial.png)

The weather by the imperial system.

## How to use

Copy repo -> npm install -> expo start (or npm start) -> connect with device/emulator.
